</ul>

<h2>HW 18: 10/16/2023</h2>

<p>A big part of using classes in Java is thinking about the design of the class. Youâ€™ll need to figure out what information needs to be in the class For instance, in our Rectangle class, we needed to know the width and height.
This exercise is a free response question. Imagine that someone comes to you and asks you to design a class that represents a Employee.</p>

<p>What instance variables should the Employee class have?</p>

<p>What do the instance variables represent? What are the types of those instance variables? What methods would you implement in your Employee class?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a folder 18_objects in your homework directory.</li>
  <li>Inside folder 18_objects, upload you responses. It could be a txt, md, or pdf file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>HW 07: 09/20/2023</h2>
<p>Go inside the folder homework, and create a folder 07_snooze. Inside this folder, you will write the following java file:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     <b>NoonSnooze.java</b>: This program should ask the user for a number that represents the number of minutes, snooze, that have elapsed since 12:00 pm (noon) and prints the resulting time. Assume a 12-hour clock (with 'am' and 'pm'). You must not use loops. If the snooze value is negative, print a warning message: "No negative values are allowed".
     <p>Examples:</p>
     <p>If the user input is 50, the output should be 12:50 pm</p>
     <p>If the user input is 100, the output should be 1:40 pm</p>
     <p>If the user input is 721, the output should be 12:01 am</p>
     <p>If the user input is 11111, the output should be 5:11 am</p>
     <p>If the user input is -10, the output should be No negative values are allowed</p>
