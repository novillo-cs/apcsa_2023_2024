<p>Please install and configure the tools needed for this class at home:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install Git:
    <ul>
      <li>Mac and Linux have it installed by default.</li>
      <li>Windows: Install git and the shell gitbash from <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">here</a>. This includes git, gitbash, and has shell integration so that you can right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer to access gitbash at that location.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Connect to GitHub with SSH and clone your repo assignments: Follow the steps we did in class. You may also find these steps on our webpage "Git and SSH" under the menu "Tools" on our class website.</li>
  <li>Get familiar with the basic Linux commands posted on the website under the menu "Tools".</li>
  <li>If you are going to use VSCodium as an editor, please install it on your home machines. You are free to use any editor. Basic editors such as Notepad work perfectly. VSCodiumn is suggested because that is what we have in the lab machines.</li>
